# foodev

This project was made in an attempt to organize orders and deliveries for a small food delivery business.

Techs that I used:
  - Node.js with express to handling the requests and responses.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose doing the database connection.
  - EJS is used to create a simplified front without any framework like ReactJS or VueJS.
  - Everything configured to use env variables and dotenv.

### Currently in refactoring process!
